# Exercises: Functions

Watch this video for an introduction to functions. Functions are often use to solve partial programming problems, which can then be connected together to solve a larger problem.

After watching, take your Programming Basics book and do all exercises from chapters 10 and 11. It's important to do the exercises by hand (on paper), without using a calculator! When done like that, you'll develop a little bit of intuition about the basic calculations that are part of many computer programs. You will need it for the next module.

After completing your practice exercises you can take an online test. We intend you to make it without errors. When you fail the online test, you should probably try to take it again (and discuss your wrong answers on Ed!).

> Especially take care of writing 5.0 when the answer is a floating-point number, and writing 5 if the answer is an integer! We ask you to do this correctly so you show that you understand the difference.

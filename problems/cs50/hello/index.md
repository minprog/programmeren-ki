# Hello

Hello, world! This is your first problem in C.

- To get started, the first thing you do is create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join). This website is used by software developers around the world to collaborate. In later courses, you might use the website directly to put your own programs on! However, for this course, we use GitHub's login mechanism to allow you access to a few other websites created by Harvard's CS50 team.

- Then, head to the [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/cs50x/2020/hello/lab/) problem at *CS50 Lab*. You will need to authorize GitHub to allow you to login!

# Lab: Queue

If you haven't yet, create an account at GitHub. For now, you'll only need it to access the Game of Cards exercises, but in later courses you'll be submitting your programs on that website!

[Follow this link](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/objects/master/queue/lab) to get started.

After finishing, you should download your `queue.py` from the lab and submit it below.

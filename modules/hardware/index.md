Let's dive into hardware a bit more. David explains about bits and bytes, and explains how computers generally work. After that, we've got a couple of questions for you!

## Questions

If, like me, you sometimes count using your fingers, odds are you can count up to 5 things on one hand (using 5 fingers). But that's if you're using "unary" notation, whereby you only have a single digit (pun intended) at your disposal, a finger, which you can think of as a 1. Binary, by contrast, allows you to use two digits, 0 and 1. How high could you count on one hand (with 5 fingers) using binary? Assume that a raised finger represents a 1 and a lowered finger represents a 0.

Recall that we looked at ASCII in lecture, which uses just 7 or 8 bits to represent letters of the alphabet. Read up on "Unicode," as via Google, and explain in your own words how Unicode is able to represent many more symbols than can ASCII, which is particularly helpful for written languages with many more characters than English.

There's a way to make this meaningful; find it!

If asked by someone how much memory your computer has, odds are they're asking how much RAM your computer has. But laptops and desktops have other kinds of memory. Cite at least one and explain in your own words how it differs from RAM.

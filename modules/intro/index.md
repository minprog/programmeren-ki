# Module 0: Hello, World

In this module, you'll write your first programs! You'll first create a full program in Scratch, a fun language that makes a lot of complex things easy to do, like animating pictures on the screen. And then we will transition to C, but all in due time. Let's get started!

## Grading

You will submit three times during this module. None of the submissions will receive a grade.

Your Scratch program will be automatically checked for adherence to the requirements that are specified in the assignment (i.e., using two sprites, three scripts, etc.). Your mentor will also try out your game, artwork or animation and provide some feedback during next week's section meeting!

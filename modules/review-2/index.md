# Code review 2 (Conversion & Caffeine)

> Warning: do not start code review until you **and** your partner are completely done and have submitted working versions of each program in the module. If you haven't finished your programs you should ask for help on that specifically and never look at someone else's code.
> Additionaly, your mentor should assign a partner for you: each week, it will be a **different** one. This is make sure that you encounter as many insights as possible about writing good code.

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. In the code review, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of **aspects** that you should consider during the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on by the staff.

## What to do

1.  Before you start, use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation, whitespace and comments. However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. Feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

2.  For this module, you will assess and improve your code along the following aspects. Take your time to fully read and grasp the descriptions there before you perform the review with your partner.

    - [Formatting](/quality/aspects/formatting)
    - [Comments](/quality/aspects/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/aspects/naming) ðŸ†•
    - [Cleanup](/quality/aspects/cleanup) ðŸ†•

3.  Then, you should sit next to your assigned partner. You will take turns as reviewer. Generally, one person talks, the other listens.

    -   Participant #1 gets access to participant #2's computer.
    
    -   Participant #2 will think aloud while trying to understand the code, and ask questions about what they do not understand.
    
    -   Participant #2 focuses on listening and making notes, but may answer any questions.
    
    -   Participant #1 can also provide concrete advice if they feel that this is useful. Participant #2 freely decides what to do with this advice.

    -   When done (after about 10 minutes), switch roles. Do NOT do the reviews of each other's code at the same time.

4.  Finally, take 30--60 minutes or so to improve your programs by considering the feedback that you got in the review. Don't forget to re-read the explanations of the aspects once more. In addition, it is completely acceptable to improve your programs in other ways.

## What to submit

Below, you will submit improved versions of your programs. In addition, you are going to document who helped you review your code and what changes you made in response to the review. That information is needed for grading!

Which student(s) contributed to reviewing your code?
<input name="form[reviewers]" type="text" required>

What changes did you make to your code in response to the reviews, and why? Take into account all of the listed aspects.
<textarea name="form[changes]" rows="8" required></textarea>

What did you **not** change in response to the reviews, and why?
<textarea name="form[not_changed]" rows="3" required></textarea>

## What to Do

### 1. Preparation

Watch the lecture on [Arrays](/lectures/arrays).

### 2. Problems

Implement solutions to these three problems:

- [Initials](/problems/initials-less)
- [Caesar](/problems/caesar)
- [Vigenere](/problems/vigenere)

Before submitting, always keep in mind the course's policy on [collaboration and academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (plagiarism!).

### 3. Hacker Problems

Solving and submitting the hacker problems in addition to the standard problems may earn you 1 extra point for this module. However, you must submit all problems before the original deadline to be eligible for this point.

- [Initials](/problems/initials-more), for those more comfortable
- [Crack](/problems/crack), for those more comfortable

### 4. Tests

Study and take the tests:

- [Control Flow](/exercises/control-flow)
- [Loops](/exercises/loops)

### 5. Code review

Only after the deadline, you should perform code reviews with one or more other students, and re-submit some of your programs.

# Code review: Mispellings

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. Here, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of aspects to consider for the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on.

## What to do

1.  For this module, you will assess and improve your code along just two criteria:

    - Style: can someone easily read your code and infer the underlying structure?
	    - Is your choice of indentation etc. applied consistently?
	    - Are your comments well-written and appropriately placed?
	    - (and everything you learned previously)
    - Design: is your solution well thought-out and elegant?
	    - Does the code make good use of everything the language has to offer?
	    - Are parts of the code as simple as possible?
	    - Is the whole of the code as simple as possible? (trade-off!)
	    - (you previously learned about things to keep an eye on, such as excessive nesting)

2.  Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will review their code on the criteria above, and they will review your code.

3.  Finally, **improve your programs** by considering the feedback that you got in the review.

## What to submit

Below, you will submit improved versions of your programs. In addition, you are going to document who helped you review your code and what changes you made in response to the review. That information is needed for grading!

Which student(s) contributed to reviewing your code?

What changes did you make to your code in response to the reviews and feedback that you received?
<textarea name="form[changes]" rows="8" required></textarea>

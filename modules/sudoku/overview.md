# Module 6: Sudoku

In this module you'll implement a larger program, a sudoku solver. To do this you'll implement different algorithms from the fields of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Once you have a solver, you can use it to generate new sudoku puzzles!


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Scope](/quality-aspects/scope)
- [Comments](/quality-aspects/comments)
- [Duplication](/quality-aspects/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality-aspects/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from previous weeks: [Magic numbers](/quality-aspects/magic-numbers), [Naming](/quality-aspects/naming) & [Whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace).

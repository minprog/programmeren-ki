# Installing Jupyter Notebooks

Alright, here we go again! In this week's problems, we will be using a system called Jupyter Notebooks. In order to install Jupyter, execute the below in your CS50 IDE's terminal window.

> **Warning** If you have been running the CS50 IDE using Safari on Mac, you should now switch to Chrome or Firefox. If you want, you can also run Python and Jupyter Notebooks from your own computer instead of via the CS50 IDE.

Log into <https://ide.cs50.io/> and execute the below in a terminal window.

    mkdir ~/module5/
    cd ~/module5/

Then install Jupyter in your IDE using our special script:

    wget https://progik.mprog.nl/course/modules/data/install/install_jupyter_38.sh
    bash install_jupyter_38.sh
    rm install_jupyter_38.sh

This will, in turn, **download** the script, then **run** the script and finally **remove** the script again.

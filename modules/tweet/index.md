# Module 4: Python

In this module, you'll learn about a new programming language called Python. You'll find that the concepts in programming are consistent between languages, but the syntax differs ever so slightly. There are other differences in languages, Python for instance is a high level programming language. It's much further away from the 1's and 0's than for instance C is. Python as a language is more expressive, that means you'll be able to more with less code. Everything is a trade off though, as you won't have the complete control over every tiny detail in your code that C does give you.

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Magic numbers](/quality-aspects/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality-aspects/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality-aspects/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality-aspects/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from previous weeks: [comments](/quality-aspects/comments), [naming](/quality-aspects/naming), [whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace).

## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

2. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus) (like plagiarism).

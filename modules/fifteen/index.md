# Module 3: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn more about arrays, and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!

## What to Do

### 1. Preparation

Watch the lecture on [Algorithms](/lectures/algorithms).

### 2. Problems

Implement solutions to these two problems:

- [Find](/problems/find-less)
- [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen-less)

Before submitting, always keep in mind the course's policy on [collaboration and academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (plagiarism!).

### 3. Hacker Problems

Solving and submitting the hacker problems in addition to the standard problems may earn you 1 extra point for this module. However, you must submit all problems before the original deadline to be eligible for this point.

- [Find](/problems/find-more)
- [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen-more)

### 4. Tests

Study and take the tests:

- [Arrays](/exercises/arrays)
- [Algorithms](/exercises/algorithms)

### 5. Code review

Only after the deadline, you should perform code reviews with one or more other students, and re-submit some of your programs.

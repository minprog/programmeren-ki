# Code review: Fifteen

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. Here, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of aspects to consider for the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on.

## What to do

1.  For this module, you will assess and improve your code along the following six criteria:

    - [Loops](/quality/loops) (NEW!)
    - [Nesting](/quality/nesting)
    - [Comments](/quality/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/naming)
    - [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
    - [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

2.  Before you start, don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. And feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

3.  Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will **sit together** behind your computer, and they will review you code on the criteria above. They will think aloud and ask you what they do not understand, and tell you what advice they have. Make notes.

4.  Finally, **improve your programs** by considering the feedback that you got in the review. Don't forget to re-read the criteria explanations once more!

## What to submit

Below, you will submit improved versions of your programs. In addition, you are going to document who helped you review your code and what changes you made in response to the review. That information is needed for grading!

Which student(s) contributed to reviewing your code?

What changes did you make to your code in response to the reviews and feedback that you received?
<textarea name="form[changes]" rows="8" required></textarea>
